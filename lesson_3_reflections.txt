1. When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   I would like to create a remote repository when you can collaborate with other people and they are
   able to modify, add or create branches, commits in a project. 
   
2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote      r    repository?
   Because you may just want to focus on what you are doing before getting new information that you may add either in a merged    branch or in the master branch.
