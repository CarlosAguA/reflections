1. When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   I would like to create a remote repository when you can collaborate with other people and they are
   able to modify, add or create branches, commits in a project. 
   
2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote      r    repository?
   Because you may just want to focus on what you are doing before getting new information that you may add either in a merged    branch or in the master branch.
 
 3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    To fork is a term used only within github. It lets a user to clone someoneÂ´s repository to your repository.  It is the same 
    than clone.
    To clone is to copy a repository either remote or within your computer and it is used within git bash / command line. 
   Branches are part of a project that at the same time can be cloned, pushed or pulled to a remote or local repository. You   always have to specify the branch you want to clone or pull.
